Project Description:
The project revolves around the development of an AI model for image classification using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of Zalando's article images, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes, including T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle Boot.
This project's main objective is to create a robust AI model capable of accurately classifying clothing items based on their images. This model will serve as a demonstration of the practical application of machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in real-world scenarios, particularly in the fashion industry.
Throughout the project, various tasks will be undertaken, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature visualization, model training and testing, and evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Also, techniques like dimensionality reduction and feature importance visualization will be used to gain insights into the dataset and model behavior.

Dataset Selection:
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
Content
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.
Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
	0 T-shirt/top
	1 Trouser
	2 Pullover
	3 Dress
	4 Coat
	5 Sandal
	6 Shirt
	7 Sneaker
	8 Bag
	9 Ankle Boot

TL; DR
•	Each row is a separate image.
•	Column 1 is the class label.
•	Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).
•	Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for training machine learning models. In this section, we discuss the various preprocessing steps applied to the Fashion-MNIST dataset:
1.	Missing Values Handling: Fortunately, the Fashion-MNIST dataset does not contain any missing values, so no imputation or removal of missing values was necessary.
2.	Normalization: Since pixel values in the images range from 0 to 255, normalization was performed to scale the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. This process helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training of neural networks.
3.	Reshaping the Data: The original dataset contains images represented as 28x28 arrays. To feed them into a neural network, the images were reshaped into a flat array of 784 pixels.
4.	One-Hot Encoding of Labels: The labels in the dataset are categorical, representing different types of clothing items. To facilitate classification tasks, one-hot encoding was applied to convert categorical labels into binary vectors. Each label was transformed into a vector of length 10, with a 1 at the index corresponding to the class label and 0s elsewhere.

By performing these preprocessing steps, the dataset was cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for training machine learning models. This ensures that the model can effectively learn patterns from the data during the training process.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical phase in understanding the characteristics and patterns present in the dataset. In this section, we explore various aspects of the Fashion-MNIST dataset:
1.	Distribution of Classes:


Insights: The balanced class distribution ensures that the model does not favor any particular class, leading to unbiased learning and evaluation.

2.	Pixel Intensity Distribution:
•	Insights: The graph shows a high frequency of pixels with an intensity of 0, indicating that a large portion of the image is very dark or black. Other pixel intensities are much less frequent, suggesting sparse variations in brightness. This distribution implies the image might have significant shadowed or underexposed areas, with few bright regions.

3.	Pixel Intensity Distribution of 10 Random Pixels


•	Insights: The graphs show the distribution of pixel intensities at various pixel positions (pixel10, pixel200, etc.). Most positions exhibit a high density of low-intensity pixels, indicating dark areas. However, some positions (pixel350, pixel470, pixel600) show significant pixel values at higher intensities, suggesting brighter regions. This variation indicates that while many parts of the image are dark, there are notable areas of increased brightness, leading to a more complex overall intensity distribution.

4.	Pixel Intensity Histogram of an Image



•	Insights: The histogram of pixel intensities for the selected image of a boot shows a prominent peak at 0, indicating many dark pixels. There is also a notable cluster of pixels with intensities between 0.8 and 1.0, suggesting some bright regions in the image. This bimodal distribution reflects the contrast in the image, with significant areas of both dark and bright pixels contributing to the overall composition.

5.	Mean Images per Class:


•	Insights: Mean images provide a visual representation of the average appearance of each class. They highlight the distinctive features of each clothing item category, aiding in understanding the variability within the dataset.

6.	Pairwise Pixel Correlation:



•	Insights: This heat map reveals the relationships between pixels within the images. The strong diagonal line indicates that each pixel is perfectly correlated with itself, as expected. The repeating patterns suggest that certain groups of pixels have similar correlation structures, indicating periodic relationships. The color variation from blue to yellow shows a range of correlation strengths, highlighting areas of strong and weak correlations among pixel pairs. The heatmap's symmetry about the diagonal confirms that the correlation between any two pixels is bidirectional.


7.	Visualize Sample Images:

•	Insights: Visual inspection of sample images allows us to qualitatively assess the quality and diversity of images in the dataset. It helps in identifying any potential issues such as image quality, noise, or mislabeling.

By conducting this analysis, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics, which is essential for making informed decisions during model development and training. The insights obtained from EDA guide further preprocessing steps and model design choices, ultimately leading to more effective machine learning models.

Feature Visualization:
Feature visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset's features and their relationships. In this section, we utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature visualization:

•	Feature Visualization using PCA:

 PCA was applied to Fashion-MNIST pixel intensity values, excluding labels. Data was standardized and reduced to two principal components ('pca-one' and 'pca-two'). Scatter plot showed distinct clusters for different clothing items.




•	Insights: The plot reveals that certain categories like "Coat" (orange) and "Pullover" (grey) form distinct clusters, indicating they have unique features, while other categories like "Shirt" (red) and "T-shirt/top" (green) are more intermixed, suggesting they share more visual similarities. This visualization helps in understanding the separability and relationships between different types of fashion items.


•	Explained Variance Ratio Graph:



•	Insights: The bar chart shows the individual explained variance of each principal component, with the first few components capturing most of the variance (the first component captures about 25%). The cumulative explained variance curve indicates that around 60% of the total variance is explained by the first 10 principal components. This suggests that the dimensionality of the data can be significantly reduced while retaining most of the essential information.


•	Pairplot of PCA Components:







•	Insights: Each scatter plot visualizes the interaction between a pair of principal components, with different colors representing various clothing categories. The diagonal plots show the distribution density of individual components for each category. The distinct clusters for "Coat" (orange) and "Pullover" (grey) across multiple components indicate these items have unique features, while categories like "Shirt" (red) and "T-shirt/top" (green) overlap more, suggesting similar visual characteristics. This multi-dimensional view helps understand the variance and separability of different fashion items.







•	Distribution of PCA Components:

•	Insights: Understanding the distribution of PCA components helps in assessing their spread and identifying any skewness or outliers. It provides insights into the variability and range of values captured by each principal component.

By visualizing features using PCA, we gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure and variability. These visualizations facilitate feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and model interpretation, ultimately leading to more effective machine learning models. Additionally, the explained variance ratio graph helps in determining the optimal number of principal components to retain, balancing model complexity and information retention.
